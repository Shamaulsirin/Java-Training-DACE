#String-Immutable.StringBuffer.StringBuilder
when String object needs to be modified very often we should not use string object.

#StringBuffer -java.lang -Mutable class -synchronised class
We cannot make the string literal as mutable by using the StringBuffer.
'StringBuffer sb ="abc";'

#Synchronized
A thread -safe mutable sequence of characters. A string buffer is like a String, but can be modified.


*String Buffer is thread safe
All methods are synchronized methods

#Synchronizedmobile---->speaker

playsong()--speaker
Incomingcall()-->speaker
-sequential action

#StringBuilder - non synchronized class -java.lang
-Mutable class -JDK 1.5->
A mutable sequence of characters. This class provides an API compatible with StringBuffer, 
but with no guarantee of synchronization.

String Builder is not thread safe
all methods are not synchronized methods
